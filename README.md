# Cupcakes  

A very basic cupcake app I made for Springboard 

***  

### What was this project about?  

This project had 2 main objectives:
1. Giving me my first experience with creating a RESTful API. 
2. Integrating AJAX on the front end to interact with my server  

### What I did  

First I defined a cupcake model for my PostgreSQL DB with Flask-SQLAlchemy as an ORM.  

I then built my first RESTful API with endpoints for all basic CRUD functionality.  

I had root route render a static html page that displayed all cupcakesÂ in my DB, and a form to add another cupcake. Rather than render the cupcakes via Jinja, I used AJAX (via Axios) to make requests to the API and then rendered the responses on the DOM: no page refresh needed. 

### What I learned  

This project was a great opportunity to integrate front/back end development a little bit more - getting practice working simultaneously with javascript and python in tandem.  

Building a REST API was very straightforward; as a person who considers himself naturally organized, it came very easily. I can see myself doing more of this.  

### Looking forward  

I'm already thinking about my first Capstone project, and I think this project suffered as a result.  

I know  I could've spent more time on this project to really give it full CRUD functionality (and I still might), but I'm on a roll with my coursework and I'm enjoying absorbing all of the new concepts, tools, and frameworks that are coming my way.
